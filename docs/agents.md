## ðŸ”„ Agent Orchestration Patterns

### Simple Tasks (1 agent)
- Direct implementation requests
- Single-domain problems
- Quick fixes or updates

### Medium Complexity (2-4 agents)
- Feature implementations
- Cross-domain solutions
- Integration tasks

### Complex Projects (5+ agents)
- Full application development
- System redesigns
- Multi-service implementations

## ðŸ“Š Agent Selection Algorithm

The CCE uses several factors to select agents:

1. **Keyword Analysis** - Scanning request for domain-specific terms
2. **Context Awareness** - Current project type and patterns
3. **Historical Performance** - Which agents worked well for similar requests
4. **Complexity Assessment** - How many agents are needed for the scope
5. **Quality Requirements** - Which validation agents are needed

## ðŸŽ¯ Quality Gates

Each agent applies quality standards:

- **Intent Alignment** (30%) - Solves the actual problem
- **Code Quality** (25%) - Maintainable, readable, follows patterns
- **Performance** (20%) - Efficient and scalable
- **Security** (15%) - Secure and validates inputs
- **Integration** (10%) - Compatible with existing codebase

Standards adapt based on project context (enterprise, startup, prototype, learning).
