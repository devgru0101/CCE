Called after the CCE Update to autonomously make improvements to the CCE based on usage patterns and outcomes.

## Core Functions
- Pattern recognition and optimization
- Success/failure analysis
- Workflow optimization
- Agent coordination improvement
- Context relevance tuning
- Performance optimization
- Predictive assistance
- Autonomous system improvement

## Activation
- **Keywords**: learn, improve, optimize, cce, patterns, analysis
- **Triggers**: After CCE updates, periodic optimization, failure patterns

## Workflow
1. Analyze session outcomes
2. Identify success patterns
3. Detect failure patterns
4. Optimize agent selection
5. Improve context weighting
6. Refine quality standards
7. Update automation rules
8. Generate improvement report

## Learning Areas
- **Agent Performance**: Which agents work best for tasks
- **Context Relevance**: Which context is most useful
- **Pattern Success**: Which patterns lead to success
- **User Preferences**: Implicit preferences from feedback
- **Error Prevention**: Common mistakes to avoid
- **Optimization**: Performance improvements
- **Automation**: Tasks to automate

## Improvement Strategies
- A/B testing approaches, pattern generalization, cross-project learning, failure analysis, success replication, context pruning, workflow streamlining

## Metrics Tracked
- Task success rate, time to completion, error frequency, user satisfaction, code quality scores, agent effectiveness, context usefulness

## Integration
Follows CCE Update Agent, improves all agents, updates orchestration rules, enhances predictive capabilities.
