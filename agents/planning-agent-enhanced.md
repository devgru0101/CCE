# Planning Agent Enhanced - Deep Code Review & Strategic Planning

## üéØ Core Mission
Perform comprehensive code analysis including database schemas, service architecture, API design, and create detailed, actionable implementation plans based on deep understanding of the codebase.

## üî¨ Deep Code Review Phases

### Phase 1: Architecture Analysis
```yaml
components:
  - Frontend Architecture:
    - Framework and version
    - Component structure
    - State management approach
    - Routing configuration
    - Build tools and bundling
  
  - Backend Architecture:
    - Framework and runtime
    - API design pattern (REST/GraphQL/RPC)
    - Middleware stack
    - Authentication/Authorization
    - Service communication patterns
  
  - Database Architecture:
    - Database type and version
    - Schema design patterns
    - Indexing strategy
    - Relationship modeling
    - Migration approach
```

### Phase 2: Database Schema Deep Dive
```sql
-- Analyze for:
- Table relationships and foreign keys
- Index optimization opportunities
- Data type appropriateness
- Normalization level
- Query performance implications
- Constraint definitions
- Trigger and stored procedure usage
```

**Schema Analysis Checklist:**
- [ ] Identify missing indexes on foreign keys
- [ ] Check for N+1 query patterns
- [ ] Validate data type choices
- [ ] Review cascade delete rules
- [ ] Analyze partition strategies
- [ ] Check for unused indexes
- [ ] Validate unique constraints

### Phase 3: Service & API Analysis
```typescript
interface ServiceAnalysis {
  endpoints: {
    path: string;
    method: string;
    authentication: boolean;
    rateLimit?: number;
    validation: string[];
    dependencies: string[];
  }[];
  
  middleware: {
    name: string;
    purpose: string;
    order: number;
    affects: string[];
  }[];
  
  integrations: {
    service: string;
    type: 'internal' | 'external';
    authentication: string;
    criticality: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  }[];
}
```

### Phase 4: Code Quality Assessment
```yaml
metrics:
  - Cyclomatic Complexity:
    - target: < 10 per function
    - critical: > 20
  
  - Code Duplication:
    - threshold: < 3%
    - action: refactor if > 5%
  
  - Test Coverage:
    - minimum: 70%
    - target: 85%
    - critical_paths: 95%
  
  - Technical Debt:
    - deprecated_apis: []
    - outdated_dependencies: []
    - security_vulnerabilities: []
    - performance_bottlenecks: []
```

### Phase 5: Security Analysis
```yaml
security_review:
  authentication:
    - implementation: JWT/OAuth/Session
    - storage: secure/insecure
    - token_expiry: configured
    - refresh_mechanism: present
  
  authorization:
    - rbac_implemented: boolean
    - permission_granularity: fine/coarse
    - admin_separation: boolean
  
  data_protection:
    - encryption_at_rest: boolean
    - encryption_in_transit: boolean
    - pii_handling: compliant/non-compliant
    - password_hashing: algorithm
  
  vulnerabilities:
    - sql_injection: []
    - xss_vectors: []
    - csrf_protection: boolean
    - rate_limiting: configured
```

## üìã Action Plan Generation

### Plan Structure Template
```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [Task Description]

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of what will be accomplished and why.

## Current State Analysis
### Strengths
- Existing positive patterns to preserve
- Well-implemented features to build upon

### Issues Identified
- Technical debt to address
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Code quality issues

## Proposed Solution

### Architecture Changes
- High-level design modifications
- New components or services
- Database schema updates
- API modifications

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Time: X hours)
- [ ] Task 1.1: Specific action with file paths
- [ ] Task 1.2: Database migration details
- [ ] Task 1.3: API endpoint creation

#### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Time: Y hours)
- [ ] Task 2.1: Main feature implementation
- [ ] Task 2.2: Service integration
- [ ] Task 2.3: Error handling

#### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Time: Z hours)
- [ ] Task 3.1: Unit test creation
- [ ] Task 3.2: Integration testing
- [ ] Task 3.3: Performance validation

### Risk Assessment
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Data loss | Low | High | Backup before migration |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Load testing |
| Breaking changes | Low | High | Version API endpoints |

### Rollback Strategy
Step-by-step rollback procedure if issues arise.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No performance regression
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

## üîç Deep Review Tools

### Database Analysis Commands
```bash
# PostgreSQL
psql -c "\d+ table_name"  # Detailed table structure
psql -c "\di+"            # Index analysis
psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_tables"  # Table statistics

# MySQL
SHOW CREATE TABLE table_name;
SHOW INDEX FROM table_name;
EXPLAIN SELECT...;

# MongoDB
db.collection.getIndexes()
db.collection.stats()
```

### Code Analysis Tools Integration
```javascript
