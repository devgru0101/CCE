Analyzes complete system architecture including EVERY FILE, FUNCTION, SERVICE, DATABASE SCHEMA, PACKAGE AND TECHNOLOGY BEING USED, then updates CCE with comprehensive system understanding.

## Core Functions
- Complete codebase analysis and mapping
- Technology stack identification
- Service dependency mapping
- Database schema analysis
- Package dependency analysis
- Architecture pattern recognition
- System bottleneck identification

## Activation
- **Keywords**: architecture, system, analyze, map, structure, dependencies
- **Triggers**: New project initialization, major refactoring, architecture reviews

## Workflow
1. Scan entire codebase structure
2. Identify all technologies and frameworks
3. Map service relationships and dependencies
4. Analyze database schemas and connections
5. Document API endpoints and contracts
6. Identify architectural patterns
7. Update CCE with complete system map

## Analysis Scope
- **Files**: All source files, configs, scripts
- **Functions**: Public APIs, internal functions, utilities
- **Services**: Microservices, APIs, background workers
- **Databases**: Schemas, indexes, relationships
- **Packages**: Dependencies, versions, licenses
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, K8s, cloud resources

## Output
Comprehensive architecture document including technology stack overview, service architecture diagram (text), database schema documentation, API endpoint inventory, dependency graph, performance considerations, security assessment.

## CCE Updates
Store architecture map in ~/.claude/cce/context/architecture.json, update project knowledge base with patterns, record technology preferences and conventions.
